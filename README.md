# Wa'dWizard: Quantum Derivative Structurer 🕌⚛️

**Wa'dWizard** is a cutting-edge financial engineering platform designed for **Islamic Financial Structurers**. It simulates the application of **Quantum Path Integrals (qPATHINT)** to price complex, path-dependent Islamic derivatives, specifically focusing on *Wa'd* (unilateral promise) structures.

> **Powered by Google Gemini 2.5 Flash**

## 🎯 Concept

Traditional Monte Carlo simulations often struggle with the computational intensity of path-dependent instruments like barrier options, which are prevalent in Islamic Profit Rate Swaps (IPRS) and Cross-Currency Swaps (CCS) utilizing *Wa'd* triggers.

**Wa'dWizard** conceptualizes a "Quantum Financial Engine" where asset prices are treated as quantum wave functions rather than classical random walks. This allows for:
- **Higher Accuracy:** Better convergence for barrier events (*Knock-In/Knock-Out*).
- **Visualization:** View the "Optimal Wa'd Path" amidst a cloud of quantum probability densities.
- **Sharia Structuring:** Automated generation of Sharia compliance notes (e.g., usage of *Arboune* or *Hamish Jiddiyah*).

## ✨ Key Features

- **Quantum Pricing Simulation:** Simulates quantum path integral pricing vs. classical Monte Carlo benchmarks.
- **Dynamic Structuring:** Real-time adjustment of Notional, Tenor, Profit Rates, and Barrier Levels.
- **Islamic Instrument Support:**
  - **IPRS:** Islamic Profit Rate Swaps.
  - **CCS:** Cross Currency Swaps.
  - **Range Accruals.**
- **AI-Powered Analytics:**
  - **Greeks:** Delta & Gamma sensitivity analysis.
  - **Bid/Ask Spreads:** Tighter spreads derived from higher confidence intervals.
  - **Term Sheet Summaries:** Auto-generated executive summaries for term sheets.
- **Visualizations:** Interactive charts using Recharts to display price evolution and probability clouds.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React 19, TypeScript.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, Lucide React (Icons).
- **AI Engine:** Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash`) via `@google/genai` SDK.
- **Visualization:** Recharts.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository.**
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Set your API Key:**
   Ensure you have a valid Google Gemini API key available in your environment variables as `API_KEY`.
4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## 🕌 Islamic Finance Primer

- **Wa'd:** A unilateral promise. In derivatives, it is often used to replicate the payoff profile of conventional options/swaps without engaging in prohibited speculation (*Gharar*).
- **Arboune:** A down payment structure often used in call option replications.
- **Hamish Jiddiyah:** Security deposit mechanism.

This application is a **simulation** intended for demonstration and educational purposes. The "Quantum Pricing" is generated by the Gemini AI model based on financial logic patterns and does not run on an actual quantum computer.
